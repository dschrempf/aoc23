* Advent of code 2023
At some point, this repository will probably contain the solution to the [[https://adventofcode.com/][Advent
of Code 2023]].

* Downloading input and sample files
I added automatic fetching of the full input as well as the samples (see
[[https://github.com/dschrempf/aoc23/blob/main/app/Fetch.hs][Fetch.hs]]). For example,
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports code
cabal run fetch 1    # Fetch full input of day one.
cabal run fetch 1 1  # Fetch sample one of day one.
#+END_SRC

* Notes on individual days
- Day 1 :: Part two was quite hard for a day 1 puzzle.
- Day 2 :: Writing the parser was a lot of fun!
- Day 3 :: A grid puzzle on day three --- that's a bit unexpected.
- Day 6 :: I loved this puzzle as it contained elements of physics.
