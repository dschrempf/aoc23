# Advent of code 2023

At some point, this repository will probably contain the solution to the [Advent
of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/).


# Downloading input and sample files

I added automatic fetching of the full input as well as the samples (see
[Fetch.hs](https://github.com/dschrempf/aoc23/blob/main/app/Fetch.hs)). For example,

    cabal run fetch 1    # Fetch full input of day one.
    cabal run fetch 1 1  # Fetch sample one of day one.

# Notes on individual days

-   **Day 1:** Part two was quite hard for a day 1 puzzle.
-   **Day 2:** Writing the parser was a lot of fun!
-   **Day 3:** A grid puzzle on day three &#x2014; that's a bit unexpected.
-   **Day 6:** I loved this puzzle as it contained elements of physics.
-   **Day 12:** Part 2 required memoization which is tedious in Haskell&#x2026;
